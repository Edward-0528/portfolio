# Security Recommendations for Production

## âœ… Completed Security Improvements

1. **Removed Fallback Authentication**: All hardcoded user credentials have been removed
2. **Database-Only Authentication**: System now relies exclusively on Supabase database
3. **Cleaned Debug Logging**: Removed excessive console logging that could expose sensitive data

## ðŸ”’ Additional Security Steps for Production

### 1. Password Hashing
Currently passwords are stored in plain text. Implement proper password hashing:

```javascript
// Install bcrypt: npm install bcryptjs
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';

// When creating user
const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);

// When authenticating
const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(password, admin.password);
```

### 2. Environment Variables Security
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Rotate Supabase keys regularly

### 3. Supabase RLS Policies
Tighten Row Level Security policies for production:

```sql
-- More restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all operations for anon users" ON admin_users;

-- Only allow authenticated operations
CREATE POLICY "Allow operations for authenticated users" ON admin_users
  FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### 4. Session Security
- Implement shorter session timeouts for production
- Add session invalidation on password change
- Consider implementing refresh tokens

### 5. Input Validation
- Add server-side validation for all user inputs
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Implement rate limiting for login attempts

### 6. HTTPS Only
- Ensure all communication uses HTTPS in production
- Set secure cookie flags
- Implement HSTS headers

### 7. Audit Logging
- Implement comprehensive audit logging
- Store logs in secure, separate database
- Monitor for suspicious activities

### 8. Backup and Recovery
- Regular database backups
- Test recovery procedures
- Implement point-in-time recovery

## ðŸš¨ Immediate Action Items

1. **Hash all existing passwords** in the database
2. **Update authentication logic** to use bcrypt
3. **Tighten RLS policies** in Supabase
4. **Remove test/debug functions** like "Test DB" button
5. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing system details
